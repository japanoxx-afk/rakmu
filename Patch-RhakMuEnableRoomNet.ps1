# ROOT CAUSE FIX (v2, surgical) for the in-game "connecting" stall.
#
# In-game sync needs the host to send RMPK 0x100A (game start) over
# classRoomNetMGR. RMPKSend_* are skipped when RoomNetMGR's send buffer
# (this+4) is null, and RoomNetMGR is never initialized in our flow (the
# menu state that would call RoomNetMGR_Setup never happens). The previous
# team worked around the null with Patch-RhakMuRoomSendGuards (skip the send,
# dropping the 0x100A write) so coordination never happened.
#
# v1 forced RoomNetMGR_Setup at channel-select -> broke the lobby (room-mode
# transition fired at login). v2 is surgical: it only runs at ROOM CREATE.
#
# The create-room reply handler (0x0044CBE0, type 0x0EFF, our reply has
# packet[4]=0 -> case 0 host-setup path) contains a harmless debug-log call at
# VA 0x0044CC88 (16 bytes: push 0x4EEB7C; push 4; call [0x4EB3D0]; add esp,8).
# We overwrite it with:  push 0; mov ecx,0x6DFBD8; call 0x00423300  (+NOPs)
# i.e. RoomNetMGR_Setup, which allocates the RoomNetMGR send buffer right when
# the host creates the room. The lobby/login path is untouched.
#
# It also reverts the 3 RoomSendGuards so RMPKSend runs its ORIGINAL code and
# actually emits 0x100A (safe now that this+4 is allocated).
